# Job Finder

## Description

This is a simple tool to search for jobs easily. You just need to write the type of job you are searching for. You can also mention the skills you are not familiar with. And this tool creates a directory containing all the details of the companies related to your preferences.

## How to use

1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:archihalder/job-finder.git
```

2. Enter the directory

```bash
cd job-finder
```

It is always a good practice to create a virtual environment for any project. So, I would recommend install the following modules in a virtual environment.

3. Install the required modules

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the script

```python
py finder.py
```

## Results

A `posts` directory will be created. This will contain details about the companies suited to your preferences.
